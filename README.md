# GridView

Have you ever wondered how as a mobile developer you can layout this page in flutter?

Well a simple answer would be to use a very powerful widget called GridView.

## GridView.count

Among the many GridView constructors the most commonly used is GridView.count which creates a layout with a fixed number of tiles in the cross axis(x-axis)[1].

In this project we are going to explore different properties of this widget including:

- children to access the list of items to display
- crossAxisCount to control how many items you want across the grid
- mainAxisSpacing to give horizontal spacing between the rows
- crossAxisSpacing to give vertical spacing between the columns
